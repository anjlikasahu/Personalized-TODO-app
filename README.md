# Personalized-TODO-app

General activities can be listed under the “tasks” segment of this app while certain activities 
which have a deadline for completion can be listed under the “reminders “segment of this 
app. Both of these segments run parallel hence the user can switch from one segment to 
another as and when required.
Since the app is personalized, the tasks set up are exclusive to the profile which logins in and 
to no other profile.
